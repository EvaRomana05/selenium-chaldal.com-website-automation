## Test architecture

We know that any automation project starting with a good test architecture.
This project can be your initial test architecture for a faster start.
You will see the following items in this architecture:

* [Page Objects pattern](#page-objects-pattern)
* [Execution types](#execution-types)
* [BaseTest](#basetest)
* [Configuration files](#configuration-files)
* [Profiles executors on pom.xml](#profiles-executors-on-pomxml)
* [Pipeline as a code](#pipeline-as-a-code)


Do you have any other items to add to this test architecture? Please do a pull request or open an issue to discuss.

### Page Objects pattern
I will not explain the Page Object pattern because you can find a lot of good explanations and examples on the internet.
Instead, I will explain what exactly about page objects I'm using in this project.

#### AbstractPageObject
This class has a protected constructor to remove the necessity to init the elements using the Page Factory.
Also, it sets the timeout from the `timeout` property value located on `general.properties` file.

All the Page Object classes should extend the `AbstractPageObject`.
It also tries to remove the `driver` object from the Page Object class as much as possible.
